I’m a passionate and purpose-driven front-end developer with expertise in building responsive websites, interactive learning tools, and faith-based web applications. I bring ideas to life using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and modern UI principles.

As a **Digital Skills Trainer**, I work with schools, youth programs, and community groups — including Compassion-based NGOs — to equip learners with job-ready tech skills, from basic digital literacy to creative coding.

Through my role as an **EdTech Consultant**, I lead impactful projects in rural and underserved areas, deploying offline learning solutions like **Kolibri**, and integrating **smartboard** and **VR training** into classrooms.

With **Mavinstech Solution**, I aim to bridge the digital divide by combining **education, innovation, and faith** in every project I build.
